# "Immutable" infrastructure

This is going to be a longer blog entry, but here's a TL;DR:

I propose that instead of "immutable" or "read-only" when talking about operating systems (such as [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/), [Google COOS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs), [Flatcar](https://www.flatcar-linux.org/) etc.), we use these terms:

 - "fully managed": The system does not have "unmanaged state" - e.g. an admin interactively doing `ssh` and making changes not recorded declaratively somewhere else
 - "image based": Traditional package managers end up with a lot of "hidden state" (related to above); image based updates avoid that
 - "Has anti-hysteresis properties": (Yes I know this is an awkward term) See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis - I'll talk more about this later

(Terminology note: In this article also I will use the abbreviation "pkgmgrs" for "traditional package managers like apt/yum".  Systems like NixOS and some aspects of `swupd` from Clear Linux improve parts of what I'm talking about, but this article is already really long and a detailed comparison including those  really deserves a separate post)

## Why not "immutable"/"read-only"?

Because it's very misleading.  These system *as a whole* is not immutable, or read-only, or stateless - there are writable, persistent data areas.  And more importantly, those writable data areas allow *persistently storing privileged code*.  They have to because these OSes need to support:

- **the user being root on their own computer**
- In place OS updates

What about systems that don't support "in place" updates?  Yes, there are people/organizations who e.g. build a new cloud image for every change, and often don't even enable `ssh` or any mechanism to persist changes.  This is fine, but one problem is it doesn't really apply generally *outside* of [cloud/IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) environments, and it can make upgrades for small changes *very* disproportionately expensive.

## But /usr is read-only!

Yes.  And this does have some security benefits, e.g. [this runc vulnerability](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/02/11/runc-and-cve-2019-5736/) isn't exploitable.

But in order for the operating system to be updated in place, there must be *some* writable area to add new OS content - so it's not immutable.  The details of this vary; e.g. some "image based" operating systems use dual partitions, [OSTree](https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree) is based on hardlinking with a "hidden" writable data store.

The real reason to have a read-only `/usr` is to make clear that the content of that directory (the operating system binaries) are "fully managed" or "owned" by the OS creator - you shouldn't try to overwrite or replace parts of it because those changes could be overwritten by a future update.

And this "changes in /usr being overwritten" is a real existing problem with traditional package-manager systems (pkgmgrs).  For example, a while ago I was looking at Keylime and came across [this bit in the installer](https://github.com/keylime/ansible-keylime-tpm-emulator/blob/3b482839708675d7fdf8c25323645d56b9b36152/roles/ansible-keylime-tpm20/tasks/ibm-tpm.yml#L46).  That change would be silently overwritten by the next `yum/apt` update, so the system administrator experience would be:

- Provision system
- Install things (including keylime)
- âŒ› Time passes
- Apply OS updates (not on by default), then keylime breaks for a not obvious reason
 
The more correct thing instead would be for that playbook to write a [systemd drop in](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) in `/etc` to override just `ExecStart=`, although even doing that is fragile and what'd be best desired here is to make this an explicitly configurable option for `tpm2-abrmd`.

The overall point is that the reason `/usr` read-only is *primarily* to enforce that user configuration is cleanly separate from the OS content - which becomes particularly important when OS updates are automatic by default, as they are in Fedora CoreOS.

(Aside: I think having automatic updates on by default fundamentally changes the *perception of responsibility* around updates; if I'm a system administrator and I typed `apt/yum update` and things broke, it's my fault, but if automatic updates are on by default and I'm doing something else and the machine just falls over - it's the OS vendor's fault.  Linking these two together: Since FCOS has automatic updates on, we need to be clear what's our responsibility and what's yours)

Now, this isn't a new problem, and most people maintaining systems know not to do the kinds of things that Keylime Ansible playbook is doing.  But it's an extremely easy mistake to make without strong discipline when `/usr` is sitting there writable by any process that runs as root.  I've seen many, many examples of this.

Nothing actually stops traditional package managers from mounting `/usr` read-only by default - they could do the equivalent of `unshare -m /bin/sh -c 'mount -o remount,rw /usr && apt update`' internally.  But the challenges there grow into adjusting the rest of the filesystem layout to handle a readonly `/usr`, such as how [OSTree suggests moving /usr/local to /var/usrlocal](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/adapting-existing/) etc.

## Image based updates

Usually instead of talking about an "immutable" system, it'd be more useful and accurate to say "image based". 

And this gets into another huge difference between traditional package managers and image based systems: The amount of "internal state".

The way most package managers work is when you type `$pkgmgr install foo`, the fact that you want `foo` installed is recorded by adding it to the database.  But the package manager database *also* includes a whole set of "base packages" that (usually) *you didn't choose*.  Those "base packages" might come from a base container when you `podman/docker pull`, for cloud images the default image, and physical systems they often come from a distribution-specific default list embedded/downloaded from the ISO or equivalent.

A problem with this model then is "drift" - by default if the distribution decides to add a package to the base set by default, you don't get it by default when applying in place updates.  One solution to this is [metapackages](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MetaPackages), but if not everything in the base is covered you still have drift that can be hard to notice over time.

I think for many pkgmgrs this "initial state" is hard to disentangle from things you typically *do* care about like the packages you chose to install.  There is e.g. `apt-mark showmanual` and `dnf history userinstalled` commands.

And...trying that out by pulling the `docker.io/debian:stable` image, it claims:

```
# apt-mark showmanual
iproute2
iputils-ping
#
```

And that's the first command I ran in the image; clearly a bug somewhere.  For the `fedora:32` base image it lists a bunch of packages that correspond to the bits in the base kickstart - but that's not something I as the user wrote.

One solution to this type of "drift" is to not use packages at all (pure "base OS" + "apps/containers") like Google COOS, or to group things at a higher level (Clear Linux is more in this bucket).

I'm pretty happy though with the design we came up with for [rpm-ostree](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/) used by Fedora CoreOS/Silverblue/IoT; there is a clear "base image" that comes via OSTree, and you can add packages on top - really, recasting RPMs as "operating system extensions" (see also [this OpenShift enhancement](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/rhcos/extensions.md)).  The great thing is that there's no "hidden" state like user installed packages.  `rpm-ostree status` tells you everything you need to know.  You can see an example of this in [this recent LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/828966/).  And at any point you can reset exactly back to the "base image" with `rpm-ostree reset`.

It's interesting to contrast with the other situations (container base image, AMI or equivalent, ISO install) because package managers like `apt/yum`  usually *have no idea* about the "base image" which operates on a separate infrastructure layer.

To say this another way, over time, the state of the installed software over time with pkgmgrs is a function of several things:

- Which packages you chose to install (obviously)
- (less obvious) The set of packages from the initial "base system" installed at a point in time
- (less obvious) Which packages are "user installed"

Whereas for rpm-ostree it's really simple - by default it operates in pure [ostree](https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/) mode by default, so if you don't layer/override any packages you are *exactly replicating an ostree commit* - and that's it!

Particularly for Fedora CoreOS, there is almost nothing in the "bootimage" (ISO, AMI equivalent) that isn't part of the ostree commit.

In other words, "state of installed software" is a function of (effectively) one thing by default:

- The ostree commit

It's even stronger than that really, it's not just "same packages" it's "bit for bit identical `/usr` filesystem".  However, `/boot` does come from the bootimage, see [this issue](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/510).

Hence almost all of the OS state does *not* depend on which bootimage you happend to use to install initially.  And if you do choose to engage package layering, the system clearly highlights that list; note a major simplification is combining the "packages you installed" and "user installed" lists.

An important but subtle detail in achieving this simplification: by default, rpm-ostree doesn't allow marking a *base* package as user installed.  Generally the idea is that removing user-interesting packages from the base image is something you shouldn't do.

### Has anti-hysteresis properties

I know "has anti-hysteresis properties" is an awkward phrase (and I'm happy to hear alternatives) but I think [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis) is a great term that we should start using in computing.  Today it seems to mostly be used in the sciences but I propose adopting it - in the spirit of making [computer science more like a real science](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/10/155530-where-is-the-science-in-computer-science/fulltext).

Let's take a look specifically at [elastic hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis#Elastic_hysteresis) because it's easy to understand and even try at home.

Basically, rubber bands have "hysteresis" or "hidden state" or "memory" depending on how much it was stretched in the past.  And this state is basically impossible to see by just looking at the rubber band.  For a related example with rubber, see [the two balloon experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-balloon_experiment).

### Configuration management systems and hysteresis

This "hysteresis" problem occurs not just in package managers but also many configuration management systems (puppet/ansible/etc).  A simple example I've seen happen over time is:

System administrator writes a playbook that does e.g.:

```
- name: Allow nopasswd for wheel
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/sudoers
    state: present
    regexp: '^%wheel ALL='
    line: '%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
```

Then later, say the organization wants to change to use a separate group instead of `wheel`, say `admins` or whatever.

If the playbook is changed in git to do:

```
- group:
    name: admins
    state: present
- name: Allow nopasswd for admins
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/sudoers
    state: present
    regexp: '^%admin ALL='
    line: '%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
```

The previous change to modify `wheel` in `/etc/sudoers` will *silently persist* (until the system is reprovisioned).  And that could become a huge security problem.

Basically in most of these configuration management systems, it can be quite common to need to add a change which *reverts a prior change*, and then makes the new change.  But that's 


So here's my claim: Traditional package managers (apt/yum/etc) have a lot of *effective hysteresis*.  I think many even experienced system administrators would be able to confidently and precisely explain how the multiple things listed above (the container or IaaS base image, package manager user installed database,
