# Why I work on OpenShift and RHEL

Every weekday for many years now I've woken up, dropped my kids off at school, then grabbed a coffee and sat down at my computer to work on OpenShift and Fedora+RHEL.

Doing this for so long, over time I've refined the *why* I do this, and I want to write it down so that I can refer to this in various places.  

I was inspired to be here originally (over 20 years ago) by the [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) movement - one thing in particular I remember is reading more about the FSF from running Emacs on our school's Solaris servers.



Fast forward (a lot) and we have the rise of software-as-a-service and in particular the public clouds.  And while we say "public" which has connotations of "openness" - these are also largely *proprietary* clouds.

For businesses (and individuals), the level of "lock in" that can occur with these clouds is profound.  I work on OpenShift because it helps blunt the power and lock-in of those clouds - and crucially we support exactly the same software for on-premise.  And [our code is FOSS](https://www.okd.io/#contribute).

I pay extra attention to bugs for people who are doing OpenShift on premises (particularly bare metal) both because the problem domain is interesting, but I personally want them to succeed.

Some of this is really part of the CoreOS team philosophy - we build a whole lot on the fact that e.g. [Ignition](https://github.com/coreos/ignition) runs identically in clouds and metal.  And even more broadly speaking, a lot of the "why" here aligns with [the Red Hat values](https://www.redhat.com/en/our-code-is-open).
